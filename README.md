## Hello

 I’m Wilkister Kibor 👋🏽 — an IT student at Kabarak University with a strong love for math 🧮 and a growing passion for data science, machine learning, and AI 🤖. I enjoy building real-world projects that turn data into insight 📊 and ideas into action 💡. Outside class, I tutor math 🧑🏽‍🏫 — a role that helps me share knowledge and stay sharp. I’m also a curious soul who loves exploring topics like law ⚖️, business 💼, and travel 🌍 just for the joy of learning. I believe in continuous growth and enjoy learning something new every day 📚. I'm currently open to internship opportunities 🤝 where I can learn, contribute, and grow in the tech space.
